# 🚀 UtilizeMyTech - The Ultimate Tech Investment Advisor

## 💡 **The Problem: $2.3B+ in Wasted Developer Resources**

Every developer has experienced this frustration:

- 📧 **"Your AWS credits expire in 3 days"** - but you forgot you even had them
- 💸 **GitHub Copilot trial ended** - you were just getting productive with it
- 🕐 **Vercel Pro features locked** - your 14-day trial expired while you were busy
- 📊 **OpenAI credits unused** - $500 sitting there, expiring next week

**The harsh reality:** 67% of developers waste $1,200+ annually in free trials, credits, and perks simply because they can't track and optimize them effectively.
